# ISG-SLAS: Secure and lightweight authentication and key agreement scheme for industrial smart grid using fuzzy extractor 

This research project aims on enhancing the security and efficiency of industrial smart grid systems by developing the Smart Grid Secure Lightweight Authentication Scheme (ISG-SLAS). 
The evaluation of ISG-SLAS covers various critical aspects, including authentication, verification efficiency, and data integrity, privacy, and access control. While existing AKA protocols for industrial Smart Grid claim efficiency and security, this research demonstrates their vulnerability to attacks, necessitating improved solutions. It proposes an AKA scheme for Smart Grid leveraging fuzzy extractors, providing robust security. Formal analysis, using the “Real-or-Random (ROR) model” and “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” simulation, validates ISG-SLAS security. Testbed experiments on Raspberry Pi 4 using “Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library (MIRACL)” verify cryptographic operations. Comparative analysis with existing schemes in terms of “security functionalities”, “computational cost” and “communication cost” establishes ISG-SLAS's superiority in security and efficiency for practical Smart Grid deployment![image](https://github.com/awantikamallick/ISG-SLAS/assets/84182317/23723a42-bd45-4915-a76c-94656427c2b2)
